#DEV NOTES
This is the consumer side application

#IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER
  
  - Decouple functionality! The presentation layer will change, the underlying functionality will be more       stable.
  
  - Keep things simple and straightforward . Donâ€™t try to pack in too much at a time. Make code movable.         Make code deletable. Keep parts separate. It will be much easier to edit later on.
 
  - Your code will need to be reviewed in order to merge with master. Only an admin will be able to do this.
